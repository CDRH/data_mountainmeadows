## About "Horrible Massacre of Emigrants!!": The Mountain Meadows Massacre in Public Discourse

"Horrible Massacre of Emigrants!!": The Mountain Meadows Massacre in Public Discourse is a digital history project that examines public discourse surrounding the mass murder of 120 Arkansas emigrants by Mormon settlers in southwest Utah in September 1857, and how the creators of these texts represented the event and its aftermath. This project seeks to give users new tools to explore these hotly contested and often problematic representations that played a crucial role in shaping the public memory (or public forgetting) of the event.
